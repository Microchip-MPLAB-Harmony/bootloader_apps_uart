# MPU UART Bootloader

This example application shows how to use the Harmony Bootloader to bootload an application from SD/eMMC/NAND/Serial flash memory and receives new application image using UART protocol and write it to SD/eMMC/NAND/Serial flash memory.

**Bootloader Application**

-   This is a bootloader application which resides from

    -   Bootloader stored into SD/eMMC/NAND/Serial flash memory

    -   Bootloader executes from DDR memory. AT91Bootstrap loads bootloader from SD/eMMC/NAND/Serial flash memory to DDR memory and executes it

-   It uses the DBGU Com port of the device to receive application binary from host PC

-   It calls the bootloader\_Tasks\(\) function which receives application to be programmed into SD/eMMC/NAND/Serial flash memory over UART channel. And it loads application image from SD/eMMC/NAND/Serial flash memory to DDR memory and executes it

-   It turns on an LED

-   Trigger Methods

    -   It uses the On board Switch as bootloader trigger pin to force enter the bootloader at reset of device


**Test Application**

-   This is a test application which resides from

    -   Application stored into SD/eMMC/NAND/Serial flash memory

-   It will be loaded from SD/eMMC/NAND/Serial flash memory to DDR memory by bootloader application and starts application execution

-   It blinks an LED and provides console output
