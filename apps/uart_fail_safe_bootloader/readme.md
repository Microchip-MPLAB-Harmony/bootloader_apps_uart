# UART Fail Safe Bootloader

This example application shows how to use the Bootloader Library to bootload an application on device having dual flash bank feature using UART protocol.

**Bootloader Application**

-   This is a fail safe bootloader application which resides from

    -   The starting location of both the banks of device flash memory region for SAM devices with dual bank support

    -   The starting location of the Boot flash memory region for PIC32M devices with dual bank support

-   It uses the Virtual Com port of the device \(EDBG port or External USB to UART converters\) to receive application binary from host PC

-   It calls the bootloader\_Tasks\(\) function which receives application to be programmed into opposite bank of flash memory over UART channel

-   Trigger methods

    -   It uses the On board Switch as bootloader trigger pin to force enter the bootloader at reset of device

    -   It checks for bootloader request pattern **\(0x5048434D\)** from the starting 16 Bytes of RAM to force enter bootloader at reset of device


**Test Application**

-   This is a test application which resides from

    -   The end of bootloader size in device flash memory for SAM devices with dual bank support

    -   The start of Program Flash memory for PIC32MZ, PIC32MK devices with dual bank support

        -   The last ROW of each bank is reserved for storing the serial number which is updated by bootloader after every firmware upgrade

-   It will be loaded into flash memory by bootloader application

-   It blinks an LED and provides console output

-   It uses the On board Switch to trigger the bootloader from firmware **\(May not be supported on all devices\)**

    -   Once the switch is pressed it loads first 16 bytes of RAM with bootloader request pattern **\(0x5048434D\)** and resets the device
