Path of the application within the repository is **apps/uart\_bootloader/**

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

**Bootloader Application**

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|bootloader/firmware/wbz451\_curiosity.X|MPLABX Project for [PIC32CX WBZ451 Curiosity Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EA71C53A)|

**Test Application**

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|test\_app/firmware/wbz451\_curiosity.X|MPLABX Project for [PIC32CX WBZ451 Curiosity Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EA71C53A)|

**Setting up [PIC32CX WBZ451 Curiosity Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EA71C53A)**

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable


**Setting up the host script**

-   Refer to [Bootloader Host Script Help](GUID-E9768065-2540-409B-AC12-3DA9417F01F5.md) for setting up the **btl\_host.py** utility used to send the application binary from host PC


**Running the Application**

1.  Open the test application project *test\_app/firmware/wbz451\_curiosity.X* in the IDE

2.  Build the project to generate the binary **\(Do not program the binary\)**

3.  Open the bootloader project *bootloader/firmware/wbz451\_curiosity.X* in the IDE

4.  Build and program the application using the IDE

5.  Run the **btl\_host.py** from command prompt to program the application binary

    ```
     python <harmony3_path>/bootloader/tools/btl_host.py -v -i <COM PORT> -d wbz451 -a 0x1000000 -f <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_uart/apps/uart_bootloader/test_app/firmware/wbz451_curiosity.X/dist/wbz451_curiosity/production/wbz451_curiosity.X.production.bin
    ```

6.  Following snapshot shows output of successfully programming the test application

    -   **Rebooting** and **Reboot Done** messages in below output signifies that bootloading is successful

    ![output](GUID-9D45B2EF-7159-4DF7-BC6F-3C43C2113B07-low.png)

7.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera Term\) on the computer

8.  Configure the serial port settings as follows:

    -   Baud : 115200

    -   Data : 8 Bits

    -   Parity : None

    -   Stop : 1 Bit

    -   Flow Control : None

9.  Reset or Power cycle the device

10. **Green LED** should start blinking and you should see below output on the console

    ![output](GUID-8AF21138-F5D5-442D-AF4E-C633D606BD08-low.png)

11. **Press and hold** the Switch **SW2** and then press Reset button or Power cycle the device to force trigger bootloader at startup

12. Repeat Steps 5-10 once

    -   This step is to verify whether bootloader is triggered by switch press at reset


**Additional Steps \(Optional\)**

-   To bootload any other application refer to [Configuring an application to be bootloaded for CORTEX-M based MCUs](GUID-CC123855-6D3C-458D-8A42-C73711B21E4F.md)
